* Thu Apr 02 2015 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 4.2.0-0
- Made several changes, including one potentially breaking change, to make
  things consistent with modern types and providers.
  - Confine to Linux systems and systems with the command 'rsync'
  - Remove methods from the type and place them into the provider where
    possible.
  - Change 'do' to 'action' since 'do' is a reserved word in Ruby
  - Make 'password/pass' a provider for action on the system in the password
    files
  - No longer create custom resources in the type. This was causing issues with
    an invalid catalog when using PuppetDB
  - Pushed the management of /etc/rsync/secrets and /etc/rsync to server.pp
  - Moved server files to /etc/rsync/secrets and left client files in
    /etc/rsync so that we could properly use 'tidy'. This is currently noisy
    and we may need to pull in external Puppet patches to fix it.
  - Client-side passwords are no longer permanently housed on the system. If
    you need to troubleshoot the rsync connection, run Puppet in 'debug' mode
    and it will output the password in the log.

- Modified the 'timeout' variable to connect to the 'contimeout' variable in
  rsync.
- Added an 'iotimeout' variable to set the 'timeout' variable in rsync.
- This is not intuitive but meets what most users expect the variables to
  actually do. This is noted in the documentation and will be fully modified
  during a later rewrite.

* Tue Sep 24 2013 Kendall Moore <kmoore@keywcorp.com> 4.0-12
- Require puppet 3.X and puppet-server 3.X because of an upgrade to use
  hiera instead of extdata.

* Tue Aug 06 2013 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 4.0-11
- No longer fail on SELinux specific errors. This handles the case
  where the Puppet server does not have any attributes in /srv/rsync
  but the clients are in Permissive or Enforcing mode.

* Thu Jun 27 2013 Kendall Moore <kmoore@keywcorp.com> - 4.0-10

  properly.

  avoid conflicts.

  type prior to doing anything with rsync so that rsync can actually function
  properly.

* Mon Feb 25 2013 Maintenance
4.0-9
- The 'timeout' parameter is now a required value.
- Added extlookup('rsync_server',"$::rsync_server") as the default for the
  rsync_server variable so that it would work in a reasonable manner in most
  cases.
- Cleaned up some of the code in the rsync native type.

* Mon Jan 07 2013 Maintenance
4.0.0-8
- Created a Cucumber test to install and configure and rsync server and check to
  ensure the rsync service runs and its configuration file exists.

- Moved all dynamic resource creation and checking to 'finish' instead of
  'initialize' in the custom type.

* Wed Jul 25 2012 Maintenance
4.0.0-6

  directly. This fixes repeated tidies that had been happening.

* Thu Jun 07 2012 Maintenance
4.0.0-5
- Ensure that Arrays in templates are flattened.
- Call facts as instance variables.
- Made compression, recusion, and hard link copying optional.

  changes in DNS, etc...

* Wed Nov 16 2011 Maintenance
4.0-1
- Updated the rsync type so that it gracefully handles the case where a
  password prompt is presented but no password has been provided.

* Tue Oct 25 2011 Maintenance
4.0-0
- Added a call to the tcpwrappers module with a default of ALL.
- Updated the rsync::server::section to add $client_nets to
  $hosts_allow

* Mon Oct 10 2011 Maintenance
2.0.0-3
- Updated to put quotes around everything that need it in a comparison
  statement so that puppet > 2.5 doesn't explode with an undef error.

* Fri Aug 12 2011 Maintenance
2.0.0-2
- Fixed a bug whereby the 'push' method passed through rsync::retrieve would
  not work.
- Added an rsync init script.

  rsync and stunnel services if they exist.

- Rsync is now killed with a -9

* Thu Mar 24 2011 Maintenance - 1.0-6

- Converting all spec files to check for directories prior to copy.

* Wed Jul 14 2010 Maintenance

* Mon May 24 2010 Maintenance
1.0-0
- Doc update and code refactor.

* Thu May 13 2010 Maintenance
0.1-14
- Updated the 'exclude' param to match the man page. It works both with and
  without the '=' but not using '=' may be deprecated in the future.

* Wed Mar 17 2010 Maintenance
0.1-13
- Now supports --no-implied-dirs by default. This prevents errors when doing
  things like copying symlinks over directories, etc... It is a $no_implied_dirs
  variable and can be turned off by assigning it to 'false'.

* Mon Nov 02 2009 Maintenance
0.1-12
- Made this more flexible and hopefully faster by default.
- The define now supports the copy_links and size_only options.
